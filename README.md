# Experiments in terrain generation and rendering

## Heightmap Generation

This project implements a Diamond-Square algorithm for generating heightmaps. The generated heightmaps can be saved as PNG images.  
The heightmap generation is based on the Diamond-Square algorithm, which is a popular method for generating fractal terrain.

## Usage

To generate a heightmap, run the `main.go` file in the `heightmap` directory:

```bash
make
```

This will generate a heightmap and save it as `heightmap.png` in the current directory.
